Hæfde se Alwalda engelcynna 
þurh handmægen, halig Drihten, 
tene getrimede, þam He getruwode wel 
þæt hie His giongorscipe fyligan wolden, 
wyrcean His willan, forþon He him gewit forgeaf 
and mid His handum gesceop, halig Drihten.
Gesett hæfde He hie swa gesæliglice, ænne hæfde He swa swiðne geworhtne,
swa mihtigne on his modgeþohte, He let hine swa micles wealdan, 
hehstne to Him on heofona rice, hæfde He hine swa hwitne geworhtne, 
swa wynlic wæs his wæstm on heofonum þæt him com from weroda Drihtne, 
gelic wæs he þam leohtum steorrum.    Lof sceolde he Drihtnes wyrcean, 
dyran sceolde he his dreamas on heofonum,    and sceolde his Drihtne þancian 
þæs leanes þe He him on þam leohte gescerede.    Þonne læte He his hine lange wealdan.
